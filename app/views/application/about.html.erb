<p>This calorie calculator is my exploration using the Ruby on Rails framework. My site calculates your daily calorie intake using the Mifflin St Jeor function and then creates a sample diet plan based on that number. Throughout my exploration I improved accessibility by alt tags for images and using a readable color-scheme. I DRY-ed out my views using partials to eliminate duplicate code. I used consistent headers and CSS styling. I created and managed a foods database. I took advantage of the Rails MVC framework by using a form-view to collect user information data for the model, the model then passed its values to the controller to do the calculations, the controller accessed the database to create the sample diet, and then the results were placed back into a view to display to the user.</p>
